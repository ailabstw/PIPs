PIP-5: Add Peer
==========

The flow of Add Peer is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4bdbd0d0fa_0_0). The steps is as follow:

1. We (the requester) do not want to reveal our identity directly to the neighbors, because it's possible that the neighbor is just some random peer.
2. We (the requester) think that the connected neighbor is our potential friend. We check with the potential-peer cache, and request identifying-peer with the corresponding op-key.
3. We (the receiver) receive the request of identifying-peer. If we can handle the request successfully, we issue the identifying-peer-ack, and request identifying-peer to the peer. Otherwise we issue identify-peer-fail to the peer.
4. We (the requester) receive identifying-peer-ack. If we can handle the ack successfully, we go through finish-identify-peer.
5. We (the requester) receive identify-peer-fail. For now, we trust that the potential peer is our friend and we are willing to provide our identity. We issue identify-peer-with-myid to the peer.
6. We (the receiver) receive identify-peer-with-myid. We would like to challenge that the peer really owns the user-id. We issue identify-peer-with-myid-challenge to the peer.
7. We (the requester) receive identify-peer-with-myid-challenge. We sign the challenge and issue identify-peer-with-myid-challenge-ack to the peer.
8. We (the receiver) receive identify-peer-with-myid-challenge-ack. If successfully process the ack, we issue identify-peer-with-myid-ack to the peer.
9. We (the requester) receive identify-peer-with-myid-ack. If we successfully process the ack, we go through finish-identify-peer.


FinishIdentifyPeer
----

The flow of FinishIdentifyPeer is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4bdbd0d0fa_2_0). The steps is as follow:

1. We determine the peer-type from all-entities.
2. We validate the peer with peer-type (not reaching max peers of the type).
3. We set the peer-type.
4. We register the peer to all the entities.
5. We put the peer into the NewPeerCh channel, invoking Sync.
