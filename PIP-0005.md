PIP-5: Add Peer
==========

The flow of Add Peer is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4bdbd0d0fa_0_0). The steps is as follow:

1. We (the requester) do not want to reveal our identity directly to the neighbors, because it's possible that the neighbor is just some random peer.
2. We (the requester) think that the connected neighbor is our potential friend. We check with the potential-peer cache, and [request identify-peer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer.go) with the corresponding op-key.
3. We (the receiver) [receive identify-peer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer.go). If we can handle the request successfully, we issue the [identify-peer-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_ack.go), and request [identify-peer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer.go) to the peer. Otherwise we issue [identify-peer-fail](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_fail.go) to the peer.
4. We (the requester) [receive identify-peer-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_ack.go). If we can handle the ack successfully, we go through [finish-identify-peer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go).
5. We (the requester) [receive identify-peer-fail](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_fail.go). For now, we trust that the potential peer is our friend and we are willing to provide our identity. We issue [identify-peer-with-myid](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id.go) to the peer.
6. We (the receiver) [receive identify-peer-with-myid](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id.go). We would like to challenge that the peer really owns the user-id. We issue [identify-peer-with-myid-challenge](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_challenge.go) to the peer.
7. We (the requester) [receive identify-peer-with-myid-challenge](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_challenge.go). We sign the challenge and issue [identify-peer-with-myid-challenge-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_challenge_ack.go) to the peer.
8. We (the receiver) [receive identify-peer-with-myid-challenge-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_challenge_ack.go). If successfully process the ack, we issue [identify-peer-with-myid-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_ack.go) to the peer.
9. We (the requester) receive [identify-peer-with-myid-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_identify_peer_with_my_id_ack.go). If we successfully process the ack, we go through [finish-identify-peer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go).


FinishIdentifyPeer
----

The flow of [FinishIdentifyPeer](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go) is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4bdbd0d0fa_2_0). The steps is as follow:

1. We [determine](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go) the peer-type from all-entities.
2. We validate ([SetupPeer => addPeerKnownUserID](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go)) the peer with peer-type (not reaching max peers of the type).
3. We set the peer-type.
4. We [register](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt_utils_peer.go) the peer to all the entities.
5. We [put](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_manager_utils_peer.go) the peer into the NewPeerCh channel, invoking [Sync](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_manager_utils_sync.go).
