PIP-2: Architecture
==========

The architecture of PTT.ai can be found in the [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q44LYz0i-iMxXMD9zfV9kqwah9UJGFOaQZxs0GvM5E4/edit#slide=id.p)

Adopted from [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), we separate the architecture as the following layers:

1. [Node](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/node/node.go): The fundamental layer focusing on p2p connections.
2. [Ptt](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/ptt.go): The bridge between Service-layer and Node-layer, ensuring that the info is encrypted before passing to the node-layer.
3. [Service](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/service.go): The abstract-layer including protocols and entities.
4. [Entity](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/entity.go): The physical representation of the service. For example, in the implementation, content-related protocols and entities are in the "content" Service. "Board" is the entity of the "content" Service.
5. [ServiceProtocolManager](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/service_protocol_manager.go) (SPM): Service-level protocol manager. For now, SPM includes "Creating an entity" and "List entities".
6. [ProtocolManager](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_manager.go) (PM): Entity-level protocol manager, specifying all the protocols (operations) in the service.

Information
-----

There are 2 kinds of information in PTT.ai:

1. [Oplog](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/oplog.go): The append-only logs specifying the operations of the objects.
2. [Object](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/object.go): The physical representation that the users can directly access.

For example, we can create an article, update the article, and delete the article.
The article is an object, and we have separated oplogs for creating / updating / deleting the article.

Every oplog must follow the consensus-protocol to be valid.

Consensus-Protocol
-----

We think that the goal of the consensus-protocol for a social network includes:

1. There are enough copies of the oplogs and the corresponding objects, to have acceptable probability of the availibity of the data.
2. Based on current time, we don't accept future logs.
3. Based on current time, we don't accept the oplog before some amount of time (2 hrs in the implementation), to prevent that some users may falsely claimed that they did some operations (ex. posting an article) long time ago, but actually not.
4. All other checks ensuring that the oplog is valid.
5. In general, there is no ordering-requiremnet of the operations among objects. (We can either create A first or create B first, and then when displaying the objects, we then sort the objects based on time or other critera.)
6. In general, within the object, the ordering follows create => (serveral updates) => delete, and the ordering can be resolved by timestamp.

In PTT.ai, we adopted 2 different strategies for the consensus-protocol.

For the self-owned-multi-device adding/removing, we use [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/). For now, we adopted the implementation from [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/raft). (RAFT is used only to ensure the membership of self-owned multi-devices.)

For the rest of operations, we use the following 2-layer consensus-protocol:

1. For each oplog and the corresponding object, we first distribute the oplog and the object to other self-owned multi-devices. Each device then issues Internal-Sign with node-id in the oplog.
2. Once the oplog reaches majority of Internal-Sign, we issue the Master-Sign with user-id. We then distribute the oplog and the object to the Masters.
3. Each Master goes through the process of Internal-Sign => Master-Sign.
4. Once the oplog reaches majority of Master-Sign, the oplog becomes valid. We then distribute the oplog to all the Members in the Entity.

Objects
-----

During the implementation, we realize that there are 3 different kinds of objects:

Object
---

[Object](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/object.go) is the most basic object. The life-cycle of each Object follows create -> update -> ... -> delete.

For each object, there is only 1 create-op and at most 1 delete-op. There must be no ops before the create-op, and no ops after the delete.


Entity
---

[Entity](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/entity.go) is a specialized object. The differences between Entity and Object include:

1. The must be only 1 Member / Master (the creator) when creating an Entity.
2. To simplify the implementation, create-entity is immediately valid.
3. Person can create entity => leave entity => join entity => leave entity => ...
4. Every other object belongs to an Entity.

Person
---

Person is another specialized object. For now, there are only 2 kinds of person: [Masters](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/master.go) and [Members](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/member.go). The differences between Person and Object include:

1. For each entity, the Member may: add-create => leave => add-update => leave => ...
2. For each entity, the Master may: add-create => transfer => trasnferred-from => transfer => transferred-from => ...
3. To promote PTT.ai, add-create is immediately valid.
