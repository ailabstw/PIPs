PIP-11: Sync
==========

Sync is one of the core-mechanism in PTT.ai.

Currently the general concept of the sync is as follow:

1. Quickly compare the sync between the two nodes (the requester and the receiver) with the provided merkle-tree-list.
2. If the merkle-tree-list is not in sync, we go to the SyncOplogInvalidByMerkle process.
    * We get the periods of the not-in-sync merkle-nodes
    * We sync the logs based on the periods of the not-in-sync merkle-nodes.
3. If the merkle-tree-list is in sync, we go to the SyncOplogNewOplogs process.
4. If the sync is complete, we go to postsync process.
    * We do the SyncPendingOplog process in postsync. In SyncPendingOplog, we provide all the pending-oplogs and sync between the nodes.
    * We do SyncOplog for other oplogs.

SyncOplog
-----

Currently the steps of SyncOplog is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4d82bf1034_0_1).

1. We (the requester) obtain the to-sync-time and the corresponding merkle-tree-list. We [request sync-oplog](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog.go).
2. We (the receiver) [receive sync-oplog](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog.go).
    * We obtain the to-sync-time and the corresponding merkle-tree-list.
    * We compare the merkle-tree-list.
    * If the result of the comparison is invalid, we go to the [SyncOplogInvalidByMerkle](#SyncOplogInvalidByMerkle) process.
    * If the result of the compare is valid, we obtain the merkle-nodes from to-sync-time to now. we [issue sync-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_ack.go).
3. We (the requester) [receive sync-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_ack.go).
    * We obtain the merkle-nodes from sync-time to now.
    * We diff the merkle-nodes and obtain my-new-oplog-keys and their-new-oplog-keys.
    * If no new oplogs to sync: we do [postsync](#SyncPendingOplog).
    * We obtain their-new-oplogs.
    * We [request sync-oplog-new-oplogs](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_new_oplogs.go).
4. We (the receiver) [receive sync-oplog-new-oplogs](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_new_oplogs.go).
    * We [handle the oplogs](#HandleOplog).
    * We get the new oplogs for the requester.
    * We [issue sync-oplog-new-oplogs-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_new_oplogs_ack.go).
5. We (the requester) [receive sync-oplog-new-oplogs-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_oplog_new_oplogs_ack.go).
    * We [handle the oplogs](#HandleOplog).
    * We do [postsync](#SyncPendingOplog).

HandleOplog
-----

HandleOplog deals with handling valid oplogs. The steps of handle-oplog is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4be9e734c7_0_166).

1. We [do the preprocess-oplogs](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_handle_oplogs.go).
    * (skip checking the expire-ts because all the valid-oplogs should be handled.)
    * We check the future-ts.
    * We init the oplogs.
    * We verify the oplogs.
    * We check the pre-log.
2. We [handle the oplogs](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_handle_oplogs.go). For each oplog:
    * We compare with the existing oplog with select-existing.
    * We process the oplog.
    * We save the oplog.
3. We postprocess the oplogs.

SyncOplogInvalidByMerkle
-----

The steps of sync-oplog-invalid-by-merkle is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g54e5fb632a_0_1).

1. For each of my-new-nodes, we go to the ForceSyncOplogByMerkle process.
2. For their-new-nodes, we go to the ForceSyncOplogByMerkleAck process.

In ForceSyncOplogByMerkle:

1. We (the requester):
    * get the child-nodes of the node.
    * match the merkle-node and child-nodes.
    * [request force-sync-oplog-by-merkle](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_merkle.go).
2. We (the receiver) [receive force-sync-oplog-by-merkle](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_merkle.go):
    * get the child-nodes of the node.
    * match the merkle-node and child-nodes.
    * diff child-nodes as my-new-nodes and their-new-nodes.
    * If the parent-level is HR: Get the oplogs of their-new-nodes and [issue force-sync-oplog-by-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_oplog_ack.go).
    * Else: [Issue force-sync-oplog-by-merkle-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_merkle_ack.go) with their-new-nodes.
3. We (the requester) [receive force-sync-oplog-by-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_oplog_ack.go):
    * [handle the oplogs](#HandleOplog)
4. We (the requester) [receive force-sync-oplog-by-merkle-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_force_sync_oplog_by_oplog_ack.go):
    * do the ForceSyncOplogByMerkle process.

SyncPendingOplog
-----

SyncPendingOplog is one main-component in postsync. The steps of sync-pending-oplog is illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZvkeTeP6TtfURnftQeLJcqX-9G6xtqrtkC_wht8Ol0/edit#slide=id.g4be9e734c7_0_234).

1. We (the requester):
    * get all the (internal-)pending-oplogs and the expired-oplogs.
    * For the expired-oplogs, we go to the [HandleFailedOplogs](#HandleFailedOplogs) process.
    * For the (internal-)pending-oplogs, we [request sync-pending-oplog](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_pending_oplog.go).
2. We (the receiver) [receive sync-pending-oplog](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_pending_oplog.go).
    * [handle pending oplogs](#HandlePendingOplog).
    * Get all the (internal-)pending-oplogs and the expired-oplogs.
    * For the expired-oplogs, we go to the [HandleFailedOplogs](#HandleFailedOplogs) process.
    * For the (internal-)penidng-oplogs, we [issue sync-pending-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_pending_oplog_ack.go).
3. We (the request) [receive sync-pending-oplog-ack](https://github.com/ailabstw/go-pttai/blob/master/service/protocol_sync_pending_oplog_ack.go):
    * We [handle pending oplogs](#HandlePendingOplog).
