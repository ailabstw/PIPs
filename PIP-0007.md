PIP-7: Oplog and Merkle-Tree
==========

Oplog
-----

Oplogs are:

* The core of PTT.ai framework. We do the ops based on the oplogs.
* The data are generated or synchronized based on the oplogs.
* The oplogs are sorted based on timestamp/user-id.
* The types of ops includes create / update / delete.
* The oplogs are considered as append-only, but we need to deal with the out-of-order issues when doing syncing.

Oplog States
-----

There are two kinds of states in oplog, not-sync / is-sync and internal-pending / pending / valid. They are independent with each other.
The states can be illustrated in the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NZ_a3iHpeqi46qZnD1MaBe6xGxtYpJNTbUphNfLnLWk/edit#slide=id.g50b9a07dd5_0_10).

not-sync / is-sync
---
1. If the data is in the node, then the oplog is considered as is-sync. Otherwise it is not-sync.

internal-pending / pending / valid
---
1. When receiving an oplog in a node, if it requires the node to sign, then the oplog is in internal-pending state.
2. After signing the internal-pending-oplog, if the oplog does not reach the node-level majority-vote, the node sends the oplog to the the other nodes of the same user-id.
3. If the internal-pending-oplog reaches the majority vote of the nodes of the same user-id, the state of the oplog becomes pending.
4. If the pending-oplog reaches the master-level majority-vote, then the oplog becomes valid. The node sends the valid-oplog to all the members.
5. If the pending-oplog does not reach the master-level majority-vote, the node sends the pending-oplog to other masters.

Merkle-Tree
-----

* We use merkle-tree-over-time to quickly determine whether the data in a period of time is synced between two nodes.
* The merkle-tree is constructed based on now, hour, day, month, year.
* We assume that the "normal use" of PTT.ai is at most 100 posts / comments per 1 hour / entity on average.
* When saving an oplog, we construct the now-merkle-node simultaneously, and mark the to-update-hour.
* In the generate-merkle-tree-loop, we obtain the to-update-hours, and construct the corresponding hour-merke-node, day-merkle-node, month-merkle-node, year-merkle-node.
