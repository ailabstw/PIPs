PIP-1: Ptt.ai Introduction
==========

In the era of contemporary Internet, our personal data are owned by very few companies.
These companies determine how our data are distributed, and what data we can access.
It's well known that our data are distributed to the ad companies, and mostly what we can access are the ads.

We would like to propose Ptt.ai, which is a p2p+crypto social network framework.
In Ptt.ai, we can determine what data we would like to distribute to whom, and what data we would like to access.

With self-sustaining in the p2p framework, we believe that Ptt.ai can help us regain the control of our own data.

Ptt.ai will be capable to achieve the following functionality:

1. P2P-styled connection / storage (decentralized systems)
2. Social network functionality (boards/forums, posts, comments)
3. Multi-device backup
4. Privacy
