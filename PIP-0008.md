PIP-8: Object
==========

Object is the most fundamental type of data. The content of the object and the status of the object are determined by the corresponding oplogs.

There are 3 types of ops for each object: Create, Update, Delete.

There are 5 types of status for each object: InternalPending, Pending, Alive, Failed, Deleted.

The life-cycle of the object is as the [diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lpj6MaO_Q-E9cuGltdl8UI2WgUlKyK5Wf_5Nq-DajQk/edit#slide=id.p)


BlockInfo
-----

The abstract-content of the object is put into BlockInfo. The following steps illustrate the formation of BlockInfo:

1. When creating an object with content, the content is first splitted with blocks and scrambled with Reed-Solomon encoding.
2. If there is media-info in the content, the media-ids is put in the BlockInfo.
3. Each block computes its own hash.
4. Each block is then signed with the creator.
5. The hash(s) of the blocks is put in the BlockInfo.
6. BlockInfo records whether some specific block is synced or not.


SyncInfo
-----

When updating or deleting the object, we create the oplog and put the corresponding info into SyncInfo. When the oplog becomes valid and is-sync, we update the content of the object with the SyncInfo.

There are 7 types of status when updating the object: InternalPending-NotSync, InternalPending-Sync, Pending-NotSync, Pending-Sync, Alive-NotSync, (Alive-Sync), (Removed).

There are 7 types of status when deleting the object: InternalDeleted-NotSync, InternalDeleted-Sync, PendingDeleted-NotSync, PendingDeleted-Sync, Deleted-NotSync, (Deleted-Sync), (Removed).
