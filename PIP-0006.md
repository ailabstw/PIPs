PIP-6: Development Philosophy
==========

Development Concerns
-----

1. My devices reveal my user-id only to my (potential) friends.
2. My devices connect only with my (potential) friends.
3. For any of my action-in-entity (Friend / Group / Profile), my friends can know the action only if they are in the entity as well.

Starting
-----

1. When starting the device for the first time, My user-id and the device-id are determined.
2. The device then connect to only the bootnodes and announce the device-id, and multi-addr periodically.

Peer Connection
-----

1. My devices connect to the peers only if they are my (potential) friends.

Friend
-----

1. The friendship is constructed based on the invitation mechanism.
2. For the friend-messages, the smaller user-id has the source-of-truth of the friend-messages.
3. Once I and the other are unfriend, the original messages are totally discard. We can refriend again and start new messages, but the original messages before unfriend are not recovered.

Group (Board)
-----

1. I can create all kinds of groups easily.
2. I can join the groups based on the invitation from the group-master.
3. Currently I can invite only my friends to join the groups that I am the group-master.
4. The group-master has the source-of-truth of the groups.
5. For my devices, if I am not the friend with the group-master any more, I can not generate new content in the group, and the group is considered read-only to me. It's possible that I can still receive new updates of the group from my friends unless I am not in the group.

Multi-Devices
-----

1. We can own multiple devices as the backup mechanism and distribute the work-load. Currently we use RAFT only to ensure the membership of the self-owned devices.

Oplog
-----

Abstractlly speaking, oplogs are the representation of the state of the device.
There are 3 possible methods to have new oplogs in my devices:
1. I do some ops and generate new oplogs.
2. My devices receive oplogs passively from the other peers.
3. My devices actively sync oplogs with the other peers.

When having potential new oplogs, we determine the validity of the oplogs and do the corresponding operations based on the oplogs.

Oplog States
-----

1. There are 4 types of oplogs: valid oplog, user-signed oplog, node-signed oplog, to-sign oplog.
2. The flow of the oplog is as follow:
    * If the oplog is a to-sign oplog:
    * We compare the oplog with the other pending oplog.
    * If the oplog is invalid, we discard the oplog.
    * We do the op based on the oplog.
    * We sign the oplog in node-level.
    * If the internal-signs do not reach majority, we distribute the oplog to our other devices.
    * If the internal-signs reach majority, we sign the oplog in user-level.
    * If the master-signs do not reach majority, we distribute the oplog to the group-masters.
    * If the master-signs reach majority, we setup the master-log-id to indicate that the oplog is valid.
    * If the oplog is valid, we distribute the oplog to all the group-members.
3. When receiving valid oplogs, we consider that the oplog is valid if the update-timestamp is within 2 hours of the last-sync-time.
4. When receiving pending-oplogs, we consider that the oplog is valid if the update-timestamp is within 2 hours of current-time.
5. Pending-oplog expires after 5 mins of the create-time.
